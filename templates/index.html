                      <p class="lead">Face recognition is one of the many wonders that AI research has 
                        brought forward to the world. It is a subject of curiosity for many techies — who 
                        would like to have a basic understanding of how things work. Let us take a dip into 
                        the subject, to see how things work.</p>

                      <p class="lead">There are many secrets behind your face, the change of your love, 
                        the situation of your health, the development of your wealth and the opportunity 
                        of your career. After scanning your face, our Application will make a professional
                         report for you according to your facial features.</p>

                          <h2>Real-Time Facial recognition</h2>
                          <p>Automated facial recognition was pioneered in the 1960s. Woody
                             Bledsoe, Helen Chan Wolf, and Charles Bisson worked on using the
                              computer to recognize human faces. Their early facial recognition
                               project was dubbed "man-machine" because the coordinates of the 
                               facial features in a photograph had to be established by a human
                                before they could be used by the computer for recognition.</p>
  
                          <p> Some face recognition algorithms identify facial features by extracting
                             landmarks, or features, from an image of the subject's face. For example,
                              an algorithm may analyze the relative position, size, and/or shape of the
                               eyes, nose, cheekbones, and jaw. These features are then used to search for
                                other images with matching features.</p>
